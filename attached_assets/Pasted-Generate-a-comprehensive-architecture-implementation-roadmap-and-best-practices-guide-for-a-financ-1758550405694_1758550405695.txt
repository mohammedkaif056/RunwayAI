Generate a comprehensive architecture, implementation roadmap, and best practices guide for a financial runway forecasting web application tailored to pre-seed startups, based on the following specification."

ðŸ“Œ Prompt Body (Detailed Version)

Using the comprehensive product and technical specification provided below, generate a detailed, structured plan for building a production-ready web application. The output should reflect industry best practices, architectural clarity, and maintainability, while optimizing for rapid prototyping, developer velocity, and future extensibility (freemium â†’ paid plans).

Your response should include and expand upon the following sections:

1. Executive Summary (Rephrased & Enhanced)

Clearly summarize the product purpose, target audience, and core value proposition.

2. Tech Stack Justification

Validate or refine the proposed tech stack.

Suggest alternatives or improvements if applicable.

Clarify why each technology was selected, focusing on dev speed, reliability, maintainability, and scaling potential.

3. System Architecture (Updated Visual Model Optional)

Break down each component: Frontend, Backend, Model Microservice, Database, Object Storage.

Describe how data flows between these components.

Include optional suggestions for messaging/queue systems (e.g., Redis, BullMQ) if needed.

4. File & Repository Structure

Expand and organize the given monorepo structure for long-term maintainability.

Highlight separation of concerns, testing conventions, and modularity.

5. Core Feature Mapping

Map each major feature to its respective:

UI components

API endpoints

Backend services

Data models

Third-party integrations (Plaid, Stripe)

Describe user flows (e.g., connect â†’ fetch â†’ compute â†’ display).

6. Database Schema (Improved)

Expand and normalize the provided schema with:

Indexing suggestions

Example seed data

Optional support for multi-org (if future teams/multiple startups)

Audit and history tracking (e.g., budget revisions)

7. API Design (REST-first, but extendable)

Define RESTful endpoints, including request/response schema.

Include versioning, error handling standards, and webhook verification examples.

8. Security, Compliance & Privacy Best Practices

Address secure token storage (Plaid, Stripe).

Detail webhook signature validation, secrets management.

Ensure GDPR/data privacy and encryption-in-transit & at-rest.

Suggest pentest-ready practices for production readiness.

9. CI/CD, Deployment Strategy

Define CI pipeline stages: lint, type-check, test, build, deploy.

Specify deployment targets (Vercel, Render, AWS ECS, etc.).

Include GitHub Actions setup, environment variable strategy, rollback.

10. Testing & QA Strategy

Unit, integration, E2E coverage suggestions.

Sample tests for model determinism.

Recommendations for mocking external APIs (Plaid, Stripe) using sandbox keys.

11. Monitoring & Observability

Detail which metrics/logs to collect.

Tools: Sentry, Grafana, Prometheus, or alternatives.

Alerting suggestions (e.g., webhook failures, model error rates).

12. Roadmap and Milestone Plan (Agile Sprints)

Break down the 6-week MVP into 4 sprints:

Sprint goals

Deliverables

Dependencies

Success criteria

13. Risks & Mitigations

Identify risks (data accuracy, API rate limits, categorization errors, compliance).

Suggest mitigations (e.g., manual recategorization UX, fallback caching, retries).

14. Final Developer Notes

Tips to ensure clarity in model logic (pure function design).

Recommendations for improving instant time-to-value for users.
